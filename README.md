# 🚀 ASTRA Command – Web Dashboard

ASTRA Command (Web) is the mission control center for resilient cities.  
It transforms NASA’s open data APIs into actionable intelligence, giving planners the power to detect crises, simulate interventions, engage citizens, and verify impact — all in one immersive dashboard.

# 🧠 DataLab – The Orbital Brain
- Fuses multiple NASA APIs: MODIS (heat), IMERG (flood), Landsat (vegetation), VIIRS (energy), GRACE (water stress), SEDAC (socio‑economic).  
- Machine learning models predict patterns of environmental injustice.  
- Interactive map layers for deep exploration.

# 🏙 Simulate – Urban Surgery
- Test interventions before they’re built.  
- Cooling corridors with MODIS thermal data.  
- Drainage systems with IMERG flood models.  
- Green roofs with Landsat NDVI analysis.  
- Before/after sliders for instant visual impact.

# ✅ Impact – NASA‑Verified Results
- Closes the loop with measurable outcomes.  
- MODIS confirms temperature drops.  
- Landsat shows greenery increase.  
- IMERG validates flood protection.  
- Every number is verified by NASA’s own satellites.
